    <h1>what's the waiting game?</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <p>
    The Waiting Game encourages families to engage with one another in a new way while waiting for food at restaurants. It provides challenges, conversation starters, and games for parents and kids to play and explore together. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The hope of The Waiting Game is for parents and kids to create memories together while waiting for their food at a restaurant. We hope to see fewer families looking at their phones separately, but rather see families work together to create new experiences and memories. 
    <br> 
    <br>
    Being able to communicate with one another over a meal is something that appears to be becoming more obsolete, and in my observations, it seems more and more parents are using devices to distract their kids rather than trying to engage in a game or talk with them.
